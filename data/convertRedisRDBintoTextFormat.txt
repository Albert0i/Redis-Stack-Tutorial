To convert a Redis RDB file (*.rdb) into a text format, you can use the `redis-cli` command-line utility with the `--rdb` option. This option allows you to load the RDB file and generate a textual representation of the data. Here's how you can do it:

1. Open a command prompt or terminal.

2. Run the following command to convert the RDB file into a text format:
```
redis-cli --rdb your_file.rdb > output.txt
```
Replace `your_file.rdb` with the path to your RDB file, and `output.txt` with the desired name and path for the output text file.

3. Wait for the command to complete. Redis will load the RDB file and convert the data into a textual representation.

4. After the command finishes, you will find the converted data in the specified output file (`output.txt` in the example above). Open the file using a text editor to view the contents.

The converted text file will contain Redis commands and data structures that represent the contents of the RDB file. Each line in the text file corresponds to a Redis command or data structure. For example, you may see commands like `SET key value` or data structures like `HASH key field value`.

Note that the resulting text file will be in a format suitable for Redis data import, but it may not be in a human-readable format by default. If you need a more human-readable representation, you may need to process the output file further or use Redis data visualization tools.

Also, keep in mind that the conversion process may take some time, depending on the size of the RDB file and the performance of your system.

Make sure you have the Redis command-line interface (`redis-cli`) installed and accessible in your command prompt or terminal before attempting the conversion.

```
redis-cli --rdb ru101.rdb > ru101.txt
```
