MongoDB and Redis have different approaches to aggregation, and their capabilities and usage for aggregation differ. Let's compare the aggregation features in MongoDB and Redis Stack using the `FT.AGGREGATE` command in Redisearch.

1. MongoDB Aggregation:
   - MongoDB provides a powerful and flexible aggregation framework called the Aggregation Pipeline. It allows for complex data transformations, filtering, grouping, and aggregation operations.
   - The Aggregation Pipeline consists of multiple stages, including `$match`, `$group`, `$project`, `$sort`, `$limit`, and more. These stages can be chained together to perform various data manipulations and aggregations.
   - MongoDB's aggregation framework supports a wide range of operations, such as sum, average, count, distinct, grouping, sorting, and joining multiple collections.
   - It provides advanced features like conditional expressions, date manipulation, text search, and geospatial aggregations.
   - The MongoDB aggregation pipeline is designed to handle large datasets, and it can take advantage of indexes to improve performance.

2. Redis Stack (Redisearch) Aggregation:
   - Redisearch is a full-text search module for Redis that offers an aggregation feature through the `FT.AGGREGATE` command.
   - The `FT.AGGREGATE` command in Redisearch allows for basic aggregation operations like sum, min, max, count, and average on numeric fields within search results.
   - It supports grouping of documents based on specific fields and calculates aggregate values within each group.
   - `FT.AGGREGATE` also provides filtering capabilities to narrow down the set of documents before performing aggregations.
   - However, Redisearch's aggregation capabilities are more limited compared to MongoDB's full-fledged aggregation framework.
   - Redisearch is primarily designed for full-text search use cases, and while it provides some basic aggregation functionality, it may not offer the same level of flexibility and complexity as MongoDB's aggregation framework.

In summary, MongoDB's aggregation framework provides a comprehensive and powerful set of features for data manipulation and complex aggregations. It is well-suited for handling large datasets and supports a wide range of operations. Redis Stack's aggregation capabilities, specifically through Redisearch's `FT.AGGREGATE` command, are more limited in scope, primarily focused on basic aggregations within search results. Therefore, the choice between MongoDB and Redis Stack for aggregation depends on the specific requirements and complexity of the aggregation operations needed in your application.
